DESCRIPTION:

The purpose of this project was to reorganize and condense the code in both the HTML and the CSS for the benefit of being able to easily edit the website in the future. What I learned during this project was how to organize a basic website in HTML and how to create effectice CSS to go along with the HTML. While I was working on the website, I treated this as if I were working for a company that employeed me for this project instead of some assignment. It helped me get the idea of what work life could be like after this program.

FEATURES:

This website doesn't have a lot of features except for an interactive navigation bar to view certain sections.

TESTS:

Here is a quick test to see if the website is running how it shoould:

1) Click the "Search Engine Optimization" button on the Navigation Bar and it should bring you to the section corresponding with it.
2) Click the "Online Reputation Management" button on the Navigation Bar and it should bring you to the section corresponding with it.
3) Click the "Social Media Marketing" button on the Navigation Bar and it should bring you to the section corresponding with it.

If all the links in the Navigation Bar are working, great!

LIVE LINK TO THE WEBSITE!
